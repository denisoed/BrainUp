## In Progress
- [ ] Development environment setup
- [ ] Core features implementation
- [ ] Testing infrastructure
- [ ] CI/CD pipeline
- [ ] Documentation

## Pending
- [ ] Component development
- [ ] State management implementation
- [ ] Routing configuration
- [ ] Internationalization setup
- [ ] Error handling implementation
- [ ] Performance optimization
- [ ] Testing implementation
- [ ] Deployment configuration
- [ ] User feedback collection for difficulty system

## Known Issues
- Linter errors in ArticulationGame.vue (pre-existing, related to missing modules)
- Imbalanced exercise distribution (only 1 easy, 4 medium, 0 hard)

## Next Milestones
1. Test difficulty system with real users
2. Consider expanding exercise library for better balance
3. Complete development environment setup
4. Implement core features
5. Set up testing infrastructure
6. Configure CI/CD pipeline
7. Deploy initial version

## Recent Improvements
- **Articulation Progress Display Enhancement**: Significantly improved user experience for metrics tracking
  - Progress bars now show relative progress towards exercise-specific thresholds
  - Only displays metrics that are relevant for the current exercise
  - Visual feedback with green color for achieved targets
  - More intuitive understanding of exercise progress
  - Better accessibility and reduced cognitive load

- **Articulation Difficulty System**: Implemented complete user-controlled difficulty system
  - Easy level: 1 exercise (1 target)
  - Medium level: 4 exercises (2 targets)
  - Hard level: 0 exercises (3+ targets)
  - Settings persist in localStorage
  - Full localization support
  - Seamless integration with existing game logic
  
- **Previous Optimization**: Made exercises more accessible by reducing thresholds by 20-30% and decreasing hold times
