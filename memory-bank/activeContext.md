- Vite as build tool
- Cypress for e2e testing
- Preserving user progress across difficulty levels
- **NEW: All games now use unified progress system with useGameProgress composable**

## Current Considerations
- Performance optimization strategies
- Testing coverage requirements
- Internationalization approach
- Error handling strategy
- Deployment pipeline setup
- User experience consistency across difficulty modes
- **NEW: Need to resolve TypeScript errors in some game components**
