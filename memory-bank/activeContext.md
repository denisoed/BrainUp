# Active Context

## Current Focus
- Game progress management improvements
- User experience optimization for difficulty switching
- Memory Bank maintenance
- **COMPLETED: Added progress saving logic to all games**
- **COMPLETED: Redesigned Vocabulary Game difficulty system**

## Recent Changes
- Fixed issue with currentLevel reset when changing difficulty in useGameProgress.ts
- Improved progress restoration logic for different difficulty levels
- Enhanced error handling in localStorage operations
- Updated getCurrentLevelForDifficulty function for better progress tracking
- **ADDED: Complete progress saving integration to all games in @/Games directory**
  - GridSequenceGame.vue: Added completeLevel call and level progression
  - MathBlocksGame.vue: Added completeLevel call and level progression
  - ColorsGame.vue: Full integration with useGameProgress and GameHeader
  - MemoryPairsGame.vue: Full integration with useGameProgress and GameHeader
  - NumbersGame.vue: Full integration with useGameProgress and GameHeader
  - PatternCreatorGame.vue: Full integration with useGameProgress and GameHeader
  - SequenceGame.vue: Full integration with useGameProgress and GameHeader
  - SpellingGame.vue: Full integration with useGameProgress and GameHeader
  - TongueTwisterGame.vue: Full integration with useGameProgress and GameHeader
  - MinesweeperGame.vue: Partial integration (has some linter errors)
  - DurakGame.vue: Partial integration (has some linter errors)
- **REDESIGNED: Vocabulary Game difficulty system**
  - Updated src/data/vocabulary/index.ts: Simplified levels configuration and added getVocabularyByDifficulty function
  - Updated src/components/Games/VocabularyGame.vue: Added dynamic vocabulary selection based on difficulty
  - Fixed imports to use correct vocabulary arrays (beginnerVocabulary, intermediateVocabulary, advancedVocabulary)
  - Added computed property currentVocabulary for dynamic word selection
  - Removed hardcoded word arrays from levels configuration

## Next Steps
1. Fix remaining linter errors in MinesweeperGame.vue and DurakGame.vue
2. Test the improved game progress functionality across all games
3. Verify that difficulty switching preserves user progress correctly
4. Test Vocabulary Game with new difficulty system
5. Consider additional UX improvements for progress management
6. Update documentation if needed

## Active Decisions
- Using Vue 3 with Composition API
- Pinia for state management
- TypeScript for type safety
- Vite as build tool
- Cypress for e2e testing
- Preserving user progress across difficulty levels
- **NEW: All games now use unified progress system with useGameProgress composable**
- **NEW: Vocabulary Game uses dynamic vocabulary selection based on difficulty level**

## Current Considerations
- Performance optimization strategies
- Testing coverage requirements
- Internationalization approach
- Error handling strategy
- Deployment pipeline setup
- User experience consistency across difficulty modes
- **NEW: Need to resolve TypeScript errors in some game components**
- **NEW: Vocabulary Game now supports three difficulty levels with appropriate word sets**
