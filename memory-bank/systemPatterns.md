# System Patterns

## Architecture Overview
The application follows a modular architecture with clear separation of concerns:

### Core Principles
- Composition API for component logic
- Pinia for state management
- Vue Router for navigation
- Vue I18n for internationalization
- TypeScript for type safety

## Design Patterns

### State Management
- Pinia stores for global state
- Local component state for isolated state
- Computed properties for derived state
- Watchers for reactive updates

### Component Architecture
- Atomic design principles
- Composition API for logic reuse
- Props for parent-child communication
- Events for child-parent communication
- Provide/Inject for deep component communication

### Routing
- Nested routes for complex layouts
- Route guards for authentication
- Lazy loading for performance
- Route meta fields for additional data

### Internationalization
- Locale-based message files
- Dynamic locale switching
- Number and date formatting
- RTL support

### Error Handling
- Global error boundary
- Sentry integration
- Try-catch blocks for async operations
- Error logging and reporting

### Performance Optimization
- Lazy loading of components
- Code splitting
- Asset optimization
- Caching strategies

### Testing Strategy
- Unit tests for components and logic
- E2E tests for critical paths
- Mocking for external dependencies
- Test coverage reporting
